                <h1>Birthday paradox</h1>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    This page is about one particular statistic which is in a group of 23 people there is more than 50 percent of chance that two people share the same birthday. 
                    You may have noticed that we are 23 students in the Slack channel so this is relevant in our case and not just to show off.
                    There are a few assumptions like there is the same number of person born every day. In reality there are big difference even between months.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                   Let's say the probability is called P(n) with n being the number of people. 
                   To simplify, we can compute its oppose W(n) which is the probability that no pair has a commom birthday and P(n) = 1 - W(n).
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    If we take one person born August 8th, W(n) = <sup>365</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub> = 100%. 
                    If we add a second person, this one must be born any day except August 8th so, there is a <sup>364</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub> probability. 
                    So in total, the chance of the two having different birthday is <sup>365</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub>.<sup>364</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub> = 99.73 percent. 
                    Not likely at all as you would expect.
                </p>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Let's go further by adding a third person which the probability would be <sup>363</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub>. 
                    Each time we add a person we subtract one to the numerator because one more date is taken and the denominator stays the same. We can now generalize :
                </p>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                     W(n) =  <sup>365</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub>.<sup>364</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub>.<sup>363</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub>....<sup>365-(n-1)</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub><br/>
                     W(23) =  <sup>365</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub>.<sup>364</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub>.<sup>363</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub>....<sup>343</sup>&frasl;<sub>365</sub> = 49.3 percent<br/>
                     P(23) = 1 - 0.493 = 50.7 percent
                </p>

                <p>
                    This concludes the proof. Hoping, it did not give you headache. 
                    When we are in person, let's see if there is a match.
                </p>
