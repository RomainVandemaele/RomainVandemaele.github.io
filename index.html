                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    My name is Romain Vandemaele. I am 29 years old and live in Brussels. I am already acquainted with programming as I have studied computer science at ULB. 
                    Furthermore, I trained in android development recently, and I am excited to pursue my learning journey with Switchfully and becoming a full-stack developer.

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    My hobbies include games. One way is by playing rogue-like and JRPG like hollow knight and persona 5. 
                    Another way is watching streams and videos about them, specially spreed running contents. I am also a big fan of manga and anime of all genres. 
                    When I am not in front of my screen, cycling around with a free mind is quite pleasant.

                    I propose you two paths ahead. One is more math related, you will realize that the chance of two of us having the same birthday is higher than you think.
                    If you still have trauma from your statistic class, you can choose the more relaxing path of baking some lemon biscuits.
